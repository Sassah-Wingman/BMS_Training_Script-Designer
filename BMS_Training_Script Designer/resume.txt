Hi folks!

Falcon BMS includes the ability to create interactive training missions. This is accomplished by means of "training scripts." 
These scripts are simple text files (either with a .txt or a .run extension) that are loaded with the training mission and contain the interactive training instructions. 
This guide provides a general explanation about scripts.  A complete description about training scripts can be found on BMS-Techincal Manual, chapter 14 - Training Scripts.

General:

• BMS features two different kinds of script files: Manual & automatic scripts. You can use both script-types at the same time. 
- Manual scripts have to be started by the user by checking the "Enable Training Script" checkbox which becomes available in the bottom right corner of the UI once 
a training mission is selected. The default is OFF. Use manual scripts if you want to let the user decide, if he wants to have training scripts activated or not. 
• Manual scripts have a .txt extension. 
• They work just with .trn missions.
• All functions are supported.

• Automatic Scripts user will not have a possibility to enable or disable them. The automatic scripts are useful for training missions you want to make sure they are started with pre-defined conditions (e.g. specific cockpit setup). 
• Automatic scripts have a .run extension.
• They work with .trn and .tac missions.
• Function support is limited (no user interaction functions available, e.g. WaitInput)

• Script files must have the same file name as the mission they are created for, except the file extension, which is either .txt or .run.

• In BMS most of the training missions have training scripts. These are saved in the folder  “…\Data\Campaign”

• Training scripts do not work with Campaign missions. They are meant for training purposes only. However, the scripts do also work in Tactical Engagement missions. 


Concepts:

The action of the language is composed entirely of functions. There are no operators. So, each line of a script can contains one of the following things:
• A function name followed by arguments  	-  (SetCurosr 0.0 0.95)
• A section name 			-  (StartEngine)
• A comment starting with // 		-  (// This script is to be used for XYZ Squadron)
• A blank line
